brew(1) -- The Missing Package Manager for macOS
================================================

## SYNOPSIS

`brew` `--version`<br>
`brew` <command> [`--verbose`|`-v`] [<options>] [<formula>] ...

## DESCRIPTION

Homebrew is the easiest and most flexible way to install the UNIX tools Apple
didn't include with macOS.

## ESSENTIAL COMMANDS

For the full command list, see the [COMMANDS](#commands) section.

With `--verbose` or `--debug`, many commands print extra debugging information. Note that
these options should only appear after a command.

### `install` <formula>:

Install <formula>.

<formula> is usually the name of the formula to install, but it has other syntaxes which
are listed in the [SPECIFYING FORMULAE](#specifying-formulae) section.

### `uninstall` <formula>:

Uninstall <formula>.

### `list`:

List all installed formulae.

### `search` (<text>|`/`<text>`/`):

Perform a substring search of cask tokens and formula names for <text>. If <text>
is flanked by slashes, it is interpreted as a regular expression.
The search for <text> is extended online to `homebrew/core` and `homebrew/cask`.
If no search term is provided, all locally available formulae are listed.

## CUSTOM EXTERNAL COMMANDS

Homebrew, like `git`(1), supports external commands. These are executable
scripts that reside somewhere in the `PATH`, named `brew-`<cmdname> or
`brew-`<cmdname>`.rb`, which can be invoked like `brew` <cmdname>. This allows you
to create your own commands without modifying Homebrew's internals.

Instructions for creating your own commands can be found in the docs:
<https://docs.brew.sh/External-Commands>

## SPECIFYING FORMULAE

Many Homebrew commands accept one or more <formula> arguments. These arguments
can take several different forms:

  * The name of a formula:
    e.g. `git`, `node`, `wget`.

  * The fully-qualified name of a tapped formula:
    Sometimes a formula from a tapped repository may conflict with one in
    `homebrew/core`.
    You can still access these formulae by using a special syntax, e.g.
    `homebrew/dupes/vim` or `homebrew/versions/node4`.

  * An arbitrary file:
    Homebrew can install formulae from a local path. It can point to either a
    formula file or a bottle.

## SPECIFYING CASKS

Many Homebrew Cask commands accept one or more <cask> arguments. These can be
specified the same way as the <formula> arguments described in
`SPECIFYING FORMULAE` above.

## ENVIRONMENT

Note that environment variables must have a value set to be detected. For example, run
`export HOMEBREW_NO_INSECURE_REDIRECT=1` rather than just
`export HOMEBREW_NO_INSECURE_REDIRECT`.

<%= environment_variables %>

## USING HOMEBREW BEHIND A PROXY

Set the `http_proxy`, `https_proxy`, `all_proxy`, `ftp_proxy` and/or `no_proxy`
environment variables documented above.

For example, to use an unauthenticated HTTP or SOCKS5 proxy:

    export http_proxy=http://$HOST:$PORT

    export all_proxy=socks5://$HOST:$PORT

And for an authenticated HTTP proxy:

    export http_proxy=http://$USER:$PASSWORD@$HOST:$PORT
