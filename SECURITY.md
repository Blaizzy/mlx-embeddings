# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Homebrew is a rolling release package manager. This means:

- only the latest release and latest commit on the `master` branch of Homebrew/brew are supported.
- only the latest commit on the `master` branch of Homebrew/homebrew-core (and all other Homebrew taps) are supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

See the ["Security" section of our README](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/README.md#security) for instructions on how to support a security vulnerability.

We will respond to and fix reported, reproducible security vulnerabilities as soon as possible. A gentle reminder that we are a volunteer-run project so please cut us some slack here.
