\fBbrew bundle\fP will output a \fBBrewfile\.lock\.json\fP in the same directory as the \fBBrewfile\fP if all dependencies are installed successfully\. This contains dependency and system status information which can be useful for debugging \fBbrew bundle\fP failures and replicating a \[u201c]last known good build\[u201d] state\. You can opt\-out of this behaviour by setting the \fBHOMEBREW_BUNDLE_NO_LOCK\fP environment variable or passing the \fB\-\-no\-lock\fP option\.

It will also add compiler flags which will help with finding keg\-only dependencies like \fBopenssl\fP, \fBicu4c\fP, etc\.

.SS "\fBtest\-bot\fP \fR[\fIoptions\fP] \fR[\fIformula\fP]"
Tests the full lifecycle of a Homebrew change to a tap (Git repository)\. For example, for a GitHub Actions pull request that changes a formula \fBbrew test\-bot\fP will ensure the system is cleaned and set up to test the formula, install the formula, run various tests and checks on it, bottle (package) the binaries and test formulae that depend on it to ensure they aren\[u2019]t broken by these changes\.

.SH "CUSTOM EXTERNAL COMMANDS"
Homebrew, like \fBgit\fP(1), supports external commands\.

.P
Instructions for creating your own commands can be found in the docs: 
.UR https://docs\.brew\.sh/External\-Commands
.UE
.SH "SPECIFYING FORMULAE"
Many Homebrew commands accept one or more \fIformula\fP arguments\. These arguments can take several different forms:
.IP \(bu 4
The name of a formula: e\.g\. \fBgit\fP, \fBnode\fP, \fBwget\fP\&\.
.IP \(bu 4
The fully\-qualified name of a tapped formula: Sometimes a formula from a tapped repository may conflict with one in \fBhomebrew/core\fP\&\. You can still access these formulae by using a special syntax, e\.g\. \fBhomebrew/dupes/vim\fP or \fBhomebrew/versions/node4\fP\&\.
.IP \(bu 4
An arbitrary file: Homebrew can install formulae from a local path\. It can point to either a formula file or a bottle\. Prefix relative paths with \fB\&\./\fP to prevent them from being interpreted as a formula or tap name\.
.SH "SPECIFYING CASKS"
Many Homebrew Cask commands accept one or more \fIcask\fP arguments\. These can be specified the same way as the \fIformula\fP arguments described in \fBSPECIFYING FORMULAE\fP above\.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
Note that environment variables must have a value set to be detected\. For example, run \fBexport HOMEBREW_NO_INSECURE_REDIRECT=1\fP rather than just \fBexport HOMEBREW_NO_INSECURE_REDIRECT\fP\&\.
.P
\fBHOMEBREW_*\fP environment variables can also be set in Homebrew\[u2019]s environment files:
.IP \(bu 4
\fB/etc/homebrew/brew\.env\fP (system\-wide)
.IP \(bu 4
\fB$HOMEBREW_PREFIX/etc/homebrew/brew\.env\fP (prefix\-specific)
.IP \(bu 4
\fB$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/homebrew/brew\.env\fP if \fB$XDG_CONFIG_HOME\fP is set or \fB$HOME/\.homebrew/brew\.env\fP otherwise (user\-specific)
.P
User\-specific environment files take precedence over prefix\-specific files and prefix\-specific files take precedence over system\-wide files (unless \fBHOMEBREW_SYSTEM_ENV_TAKES_PRIORITY\fP is set, see below)\.
.P
Note that these files do not support shell variable expansion e\.g\. \fB$HOME\fP or command execution e\.g\. \fB$(cat file)\fP\&\.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_ALLOWED_TAPS\fP
A space\-separated list of taps\. Homebrew will refuse to install a formula unless it and all of its dependencies are in an official tap or in a tap on this list\.

Bottle URLs however, have their domain replaced with this prefix\.
