.br
\fBbrew\fR \fIcommand\fR [\fB\-\-verbose\fR|\fB\-v\fR] [\fIoptions\fR] [\fIformula\fR] \.\.\.
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Homebrew is the easiest and most flexible way to install the UNIX tools Apple didn\'t include with macOS\.
.
.SH "ESSENTIAL COMMANDS"
For the full command list, see the \fICOMMANDS\fR section\.
.
.P
With \fB\-\-verbose\fR or \fB\-\-debug\fR, many commands print extra debugging information\. Note that these options should only appear after a command\.
.
.SS "\fBinstall\fR \fIformula\fR:"
Install \fIformula\fR\.
.
.P
\fIformula\fR is usually the name of the formula to install, but it has other syntaxes which are listed in the \fISPECIFYING FORMULAE\fR section\.
.
.SS "\fBuninstall\fR \fIformula\fR:"
Uninstall \fIformula\fR\.
.
.SS "\fBlist\fR:"
List all installed formulae\.
.
.SS "\fBsearch\fR (\fItext\fR|\fB/\fR\fItext\fR\fB/\fR):"
Perform a substring search of cask tokens and formula names for \fItext\fR\. If \fItext\fR is flanked by slashes, it is interpreted as a regular expression\. The search for \fItext\fR is extended online to \fBhomebrew/core\fR and \fBhomebrew/cask\fR\. If no search term is provided, all locally available formulae are listed\.
.
.SH "COMMANDS"
.
.SS "\fBanalytics\fR [\fIsubcommand\fR]"
If \fBon\fR or \fBoff\fR is passed, turn Homebrew\'s analytics on or off respectively\.

Install the dependencies with specified options but do not install the formula itself\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-cc\fR

.
.TP
\fB\-\-build\-bottle\fR

.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR

.
.SS "\fBpin\fR \fIformula\fR"

.
.SS "\fBreadall\fR [\fIoptions\fR] [\fItap\fR]"
Import all formulae from the specified \fItap\fR, or from all installed taps if none is provided\.

Start a Homebrew build environment shell\. Uses our years\-battle\-hardened Homebrew build logic to help your \fB\./configure && make && make install\fR or even your \fBgem install\fR succeed\. Especially handy if you run Homebrew in an Xcode\-only configuration since it adds tools like \fBmake\fR to your \fBPATH\fR which build systems would not find otherwise\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-env\fR
Use the standard \fBPATH\fR instead of superenv\'s when \fBstd\fR is passed\.
.
.SS "\fBshellenv\fR"
Print export statements\. When run in a shell, this installation of Homebrew will be added to your \fBPATH\fR, \fBMANPATH\fR, and \fBINFOPATH\fR\.
.
.P
The variables \fBHOMEBREW_PREFIX\fR, \fBHOMEBREW_CELLAR\fR and \fBHOMEBREW_REPOSITORY\fR are also exported to avoid querying them multiple times\. Consider adding evaluation of this command\'s output to your dotfiles (e\.g\. \fB~/\.profile\fR or \fB~/\.zprofile\fR) with: \fBeval $(brew shellenv)\fR

Check formulae or files for conformance to Homebrew style guidelines\.

.SS "\fBtap\fR [\fIoptions\fR] \fIuser\fR\fB/\fR\fIrepo\fR [\fIURL\fR]"
Tap a formula repository\.
.
.P
If no arguments are provided, list all installed taps\.
.
.P
With \fIURL\fR unspecified, tap a formula repository from GitHub using HTTPS\. Since so many taps are hosted on GitHub, this command is a shortcut for \fBbrew tap\fR \fIuser\fR\fB/\fR\fIrepo\fR \fBhttps://github\.com/\fR\fIuser\fR\fB/homebrew\-\fR\fIrepo\fR\.
.
.P
With \fIURL\fR specified, tap a formula repository from anywhere, using any transport protocol that \fBgit\fR(1) handles\. The one\-argument form of \fBtap\fR simplifies but also limits\. This two\-argument command makes no assumptions, so taps can be cloned from places other than GitHub and using protocols other than HTTPS, e\.g\. SSH, GIT, HTTP, FTP(S), RSYNC\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-full\fR
Use a full clone when tapping a repository\. By default, the repository is cloned as a shallow copy (\fB\-\-depth=1\fR)\. To convert a shallow copy to a full copy, you can retap by passing \fB\-\-full\fR without first untapping\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-force\-auto\-update\fR
Auto\-update tap even if it is not hosted on GitHub\. By default, only taps hosted on GitHub are auto\-updated (for performance reasons)\.
